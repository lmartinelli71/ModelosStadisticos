# Statistical & Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a collection of statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning projects developed during my academic and professional training.

These projects reflect my foundation in data science, modeling, and applied analytics, which later evolved into the design of production-grade distributed AI systems (Tradu platform).

## 📌 Scope

This repository includes:

- Data visualization and exploratory analysis
- Time series modeling
- Financial and market prediction
- Convolutional neural networks
- Analytical dashboards
- Introduction to deep learning with TensorFlow

All projects are based on public or anonymized datasets.
